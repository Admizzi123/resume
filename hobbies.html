    <h2>1.Coding</h2>
    <p>The reason I chose coding is because it is something you can do behind a screen which is actually productive. Growing up I was always an avid gamer but something I realized was that it was never going to get me anything in life. Coding was something I chose because if I continue doing it who knows where I will end up in. Maybe a company in Silicon Valley. Who knows? </p>

    <h2>2. Piano</h2>
    <p>I started to learn the piano from an app called flowkey in October 2023 (Right now it is 17th January 2024). The reason I started it is that the same month I remember going to my local group's 14th anniversary and I saw a guy playing the piano. I was so impressed that I decided to learn it aswell. Something I learnt about the piano is that it is a hard instrument to play and practice. But the moment you manage to master a song it feels as though you are dreaming.</p>

    <h2>3. Lifting Weights</h2>
    <p>In the back of our garage there is a small gym where my dad used to train. For some reason I never trained there growing up. It was always at my disposal yet I never used it. In 2021 and 2022 I was a chubby kid. The body dysmorphia I had when I looked at the mirror made me say that I needed to change.<br> In October 2022 I started to train regularly. It was at first cardio but then I started to incorporate weights and everything changed. Six months of consistence training letter I got a physique I was proud of. I still remember the day I saw a six pack after my whole life being chubby was the most fulfilling moment of my life. Now I train 4 days a week with a push pull leg routine followed by cardio at the end. I highly advise going to the gym or training in general since it will sharpen your mind and help you build discipline</p>

    <h2>4. Spending time with family</h2>
    <p>Something I do from time to time but it is important for many reasons. Most of us take our parents for granted and never spend time with them. Having a good relationship with your parents can build trust in the long term and while everyone else has relationship problems with their family you will stand there drinking a beer with your dad (or mum you choose).</p>

    <h2>5.Listening to Music</h2>
    <p>Listening to music is something I do not that often and for very good reason. I listen to very catchy music, the music you can listen on tiktok etc. However doing this affected my sleep and the ability to concentrate since the music keeps on repeating in my head over and over. Now I listen to very calm music, music you would listen on a piano</p>
